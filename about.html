                <strong>Brian Thieme, The Owner and Operator of Florida Marine Sales</strong> is a Martin County native. He grew up in Hobe Sound, Florida where he spent his time doing anything related to boating and water-sports.
            </p>
            <p>After obtaining a degree at Southfork High School, he chose to serve our country and enlisted in the Army. He served two years stateside with the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Airborne Infantry, and the 197th Airborne. He then spent three years overseas serving in South Korea where he was based with the T.A.N.G.O. Special Forces Group. He was with the first special forces group to spear-head Operation Desert Wind/Storm.</p>

            <p>After receiving two honorable discharges, Brian realized that the unique set of skills he obtained were, for the most part, specialized for an area outside of a typical "Real World" scenario. It was for this reason that he spent another five years working under private contract for the Federal Government.
                Upon successfully completing his five year commitment, he then moved back to Stuart, Florida.</p>

            <p>In 1996, he started his foothold into the marine and boating industry. He worked for Treasure Coast Boat Sales and managed the day-to-day operations in the marine yard.</p>

            <p>In 2002, he began to find his true calling as a skilled boat salesman. He was the leading sales broker at Jupiter Yacht Brokers, formerly located at Seagate Marine in Jupiter, Florida. Currently, the location is known as Jupiter Pointe.
                After his four years with Jupiter Yacht Brokers, he helped initiate and manage all the day-to-day operations and sales for Palm City Yachts. This five year period of employment is considered by some as the driving force that put them on the map.</p>

            <p>In 2012, he chose to take his career to the next level and joined in partnership to create Florida Marine Sales, where he managed operations and successfully led a team of sales associates.</p>

            <p>After three years, it was decided to liquidate Florida Marine Sales in order to own and operate his own brokerage:
                <strong>Florida Boat Sales, LLC</strong>.

            <p>After buying out his partner, he kept the same business location, <span class="text-grey-dark text-bold"><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/bZsFEjS8FT72">3705 SE Dixie Hwy, Stuart FL. 34997</a></span>, where he is currently operating successfully to this day.</p>


            <p><strong>Florida Boat Sales is a proud <span style="color:#9d0000">Veteran Owned and Operated</span> business.</strong></p>
